## <span id="quick-start">Quick start</span>

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your FinClient.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar finclient.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

## <span id="features">Features</span>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order. However, to add deadlines to remarks, the parameter must be directly behind the remark parameter<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable. <br>
  e.g. if the command requires `r/REMARKS by/TIME`, `by/TIME r/REMARKS` is not acceptable. Similarly, there should not any parameters between these 2 parameters

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, FinClient will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause FinClient to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <span id="faq">FAQ</span>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous FinClient home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <span id="known-issues">Known issues</span>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
